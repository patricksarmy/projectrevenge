# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

## ON A HOME COMPUTER (Windows) 
#### (If you're using Linux I'm going to assume you know what you're doing)
**1)** Download the _project_revenge_autoinstall.py_ file for the version you would like to use (you may have to copy and paste the code into into a file)
 (Make sure the file is in your Downloads folder)

**2)** Install [python 3](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.2/python-3.10.2-amd64.exe)

**3)** Open command prompt and type **python -V** to test if python was installed correctly

**4)** Run "py -3 -m pip install requests", and type "y" if/when asked

**5)** Type "cd %USERPROFILE%\Downloads", then type "py -3 project_revenge_autoinstall.py" (this may take 5-10 minutes)

**6)** Transfer the files in the _ProjRev_ folder created by the installer to your school computer
